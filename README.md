# Interactive-Calculus-Practice-App
Credit me!
I designed and developed a fully interactive Java Swing application that transforms derivative practice into an engaging, quiz-style learning experience. 
-A custom UI built from scratch using Java Swing/GUI with dynamic components that keep the experience fresh and responsive.
-Intelligent question randomization and instant answer feedback to challenge users and improve retention.
-Implementation of key calculus concepts: Power Rule, Logarithmic and Exponential Derivatives, Chain Rule, and Trigonometric Derivatives.
-Sophisticated event-driven architecture with reusable action listeners, enhancing UX and maintainability.
-Key Calculus I concepts made fun and engaging through multiple-choice questions.
-Object-Oriented Programming principles powering the program for easy expansion and clean code.
